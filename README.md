# DGSC LibreBooking Customizations

## Use
Drop the files in the root folder to the corresponding folder where LibreBooking is installed. The CSS file can be uplodaded from the admin panel `Setting > Look and Feel > CSS File (*.css)`.

### TOS
In order to have control over formatting, the TOS is hardcoded into the its template. In order to turn it on for users, go to `Application Management > Reservations > Terms of Service` (the latter is hidden in an inconspicuous drop-down menu. Write some placeholder text into the box, otherwise the TOS page will not load. The input variable for this has been removed from the template so nothing specified here will be shown to users.
