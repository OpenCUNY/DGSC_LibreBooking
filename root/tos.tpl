<h1>Policies and Guidelines for DGSC Room Use </h1>

<ul>
<li> Events must be student-organized with a primary focus on students. Students may not reserve DGSC rooms in their capacity as staff members for programs, offices, or other administrative bodies, which have booking privileges through GC Room Reservations (<a href="mailto:RoomRes@gc.cuny.edu">RoomRes@gc.cuny.edu</a>).</li>

<li> Event organizers are responsible for ensuring that their activities comply with CUNY Graduate Center-wide policies and regulations, including when they are engaged in any DGSC-sponsored activities off campus.</li>

<li> The designated contact person is responsible for the event and is expected to attend. If they cannot attend, they must provide the DGSC with an alternate contact person who will assume responsibility. Should the responsible party be absent, the DGSC reserves the right, in good faith, to request that the group vacate the room.</li>

<li> The contact person is responsible for ensuring that the event ends at the scheduled time and that the space is clean and in good condition at the conclusion of the event. If the room is not adequately cleaned or is otherwise compromised, the DGSC reserves the right to apply probation or deny future room requests to that individual, group, and/or organization.</li>

<li> Events or meetings in the Social or Working Lounges (Rooms 5409 and 5414) must be open to the general student body and remain accessible during any events. If you need to hold a private meeting, please request a different conference room.</li>

<li> No event may charge admission or issue tickets without the special approval of the Co-Chair for Business (<a href="mailto:ccb@cunydgsc.org">ccb@cunydgsc.org</a>) at least two months in advance to ensure compliance with university policies and procedures.</li>

<li> The DGSC Steering Committee reserves the right, in good faith, to revoke any scheduled reservation. If a student or student group believes that their room reservation request was unfairly denied or handled improperly, including probation notices issued by the DGSC Steering Committee, they have the right to appeal the decision to the DGSC Executive Committee (<a href="mailto:executive@cunydgsc.org">executive@cunydgsc.org</a>). The appeal must be submitted in writing within 7 business days of receiving the reservation decision or probation notice. This policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting or opposing discrimination or for cooperating with an investigation of such an appeal.</li>
</ul>

<h1> User Data Collection and Usage Consent </h1>

By submitting a DGSC room reservation request, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information, including your name and contact details, solely for processing your reservation. This information will be used for reviewing requests, communicating decisions, and updating the shared public calendar with approved events (only non-personal information will be displayed). Your data may be retained for up to one academic year for purposes solely related to processing and resolving room reservation requests.
